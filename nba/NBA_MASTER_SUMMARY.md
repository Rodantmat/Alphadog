# NBA MASTER SUMMARY — every transcript, message by message

**Purpose.** A complete, per-transcript record of everything done across the whole NBA build. Nothing
summarised away: every decision, build, fix, dead end and finding, in the order it happened, with the
transcript it came from so you can go straight to the source.

**How to use it.** Each section is one transcript file in `/mnt/transcripts/`. Within a section,
entries run oldest → newest. When you need more detail than is here, open that transcript and grep the
term — the GLOSSARY maps terms to their transcript.

**Update protocol.** Every entry carries the date it was ADDED to this document, so new material is
distinguishable from old. Multiple passes are run per transcript; a transcript is only marked
`PASSES: N clean` when N consecutive passes found nothing new.

| Document | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `NBA_MASTER_SUMMARY.md` | this file — everything done, per transcript |
| `NBA_GLOSSARY.md` | every term → which transcript, which context |
| `NBA_RECIPE.md` | how the system was built, step by step |
| `NBA_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` | workers, tools, sources, infrastructure |
| `NBA_DATABASE.md` | every table and column, what it holds |
| `NBA_WORKERS.md` | every worker/script, path, function |
| `NBA_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` | the three pipelines in detail |
| `NBA_OPEN_ITEMS.md` | deferred, dropped, partial, bugs, caveats |

## T1 — `2026-09-03-03-22-04-nba-expansion-phase1-static.txt`
**PHASE 1 (recon) · PHASE 2 (system draft) · PHASE 3a start (static data)**
*292 content blocks · added 2026-09-20 · PASSES: 1*

### T1.1 Orientation and recon
- Session opened from a **handoff package** of three prior documents, all read in full:
  `nba/NBA_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md` (96 KB), `nba/NBA_LESSONS_LEARNED_FROM_MLB.md` (57 KB),
  `nba/NBA_DOMAIN_MAPPING_AND_STARTUP_PLAN.md` (18 KB).
- Read memory `/areas/alphadog.md`; listed repo root and `nba/`.
- **Verified against the live database that NO NBA namespace existed anywhere** in Postgres — checked
  `information_schema.schemata`, then every table/column matching `%nba%`, `%sport%`, `%league%`.
- Inspected MLB's discriminators: `market.sleeper_board_current` (sport, league),
  `market.prizepicks_board_current` (league), `ref.teams`, `control.*`, `config.worker_definitions`.
- Phase 1 findings committed as a banner to `nba/NBA_ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md`.

### T1.2 Owner directives captured (the operating model)
- **NBA season is OFF** — this is preparation. Backfill static + past-season + market data where possible.
- Probe and **lock a source for each data type** before building on it.
- **ParlayAPI** expected to have past-season NBA data and will have live boards/market when the season starts.
- **PrizePicks board comes from a scraper scoped to NBA**, mirroring MLB's, living in GitHub.
- **All NBA work is additive-only. No MLB edits authorised.**
- Committed to `nba/NBA_PROJECT_LOG.md` (created here) and `nba/NBA_SYSTEM_DRAFT.md` (created here).
- Memory file `/areas/alphadog-nba.md` created.

### T1.3 The separate-universe decision (owner overruled the first proposal)
- First proposal was a shared control plane; **owner overruled it** — NBA gets its own everything.
- **14 NBA-only Postgres schemas created in one command**: `nba_ref`, `nba_calendar`, `nba_team`,
  `nba_stats`, `nba_daily`, `nba_context`, `nba_market`, `nba_score`, `nba_config`, `nba_control`,
  and others. Fully separate from MLB's.
- First tables: `nba_ref.teams` (team_id PK, nba_team_id, abbreviation, full_name, nickname,
  location_name, conference, division, arena_id, active, source_key, raw_json, created_at),
  plus players/arenas/officials, and `nba_config.worker_definitions` / `nba_config.system_settings`
  modelled on MLB's `config.worker_definitions` and `control.job_queue` / `control.worker_run_log`.

### T1.4 First worker, and the deploy-pipeline extension
- Built `nba/alphadog-v2-nba-static-teams.js` (syntax-checked with `node --check` before commit).
- **Extended the two SHARED deploy scripts additively** — `generate_wrangler_configs.py` and
  `github_mobile_deploy_workers.py` — with an isolated NBA branch (Hyperdrive, `nodejs_compat`,
  NBA vars), never touching MLB's paths. Created `nba/worker_manifest_nba.json`.
- Registered the worker in `nba_config.worker_definitions` (job_key `nba-static-teams`,
  group `01 Static`, phase `static`).
- First deploy FAILED on a path bug → patched → **deployed clean** to
  `alphadog-v2-nba-static-teams.rodolfoaamattos.workers.dev`.

### T1.5 THE BLOCKING DISCOVERY — Cloudflare cannot reach nba.com
- Worker deployed fine but **could not fetch `stats.nba.com`**. Added a `/debug-fetch` route to see
  the raw body rather than a truncated error.
- Rewrote headers to the canonical set real NBA scrapers use (Host, Referer, `x-nba-stats-origin`,
  researched via web search + `nba_api` docs). **Still blocked.**
- Added a read-only multi-endpoint probe: **`cdn.nba.com`, `core-api.nba.com` and `data.nba.net` ALL
  fail identically.** Conclusion: a **Cloudflare edge block on the whole nba.com family**, not a
  header problem and not endpoint-specific.
- Stored `balldontlie_api_key` (owner-supplied) in a new `nba_config.external_credentials` table,
  mirroring how `PARLAY_API_KEY` is held — **never in chat memory**.
- Owner preference recorded: **data should come from nba.com itself, like the MLB API** — so
  balldontlie stays a fallback, not the plan.

### T1.6 THE FIX — GitHub Actions as the scraping network
- Found the pattern by reading MLB's `.github/workflows/scrape.yml`: **MLB's PrizePicks scraper runs on
  GitHub Actions runners (a different network from Cloudflare), commits JSON to the repo, and the
  Worker reads the committed file.**
- Built `nba/scrape_nba_stats_teams.py` + a new isolated workflow `.github/workflows/nba-scrape.yml`
  (does not touch `scrape.yml`).

### T1.7 Four consecutive failures, each diagnosed, before it worked
1. **30 s timeout** — not a rejection, a slow/soft response → raised timeout, added retries.
2. **Timeout again, 3 attempts** — a consistent hang. Diagnosed as an anti-bot **tarpit** (silently
   stalling rather than returning a block).
3. **Timeout through the PROXY too** — which *ruled out IP blocking entirely* and pointed at
   **TLS fingerprinting** (Python `requests` has a recognisable handshake).
4. **`curl_cffi` (browser TLS impersonation) — SUCCESS.** HTTP 200, 30 teams, real live data.
   → This is the origin of `curl_cffi` as the standard transport for every NBA scraper since.

### T1.8 The self-trigger problem, and the file-based solution
- Building the scraper wasn't enough — it had to be **triggerable without the owner acting manually**.
- Added a real `github_trigger_workflow` tool to the MCP bridge (`alphadog-v2-admin-sql.js`), deployed
  it — **but the conversation's tool list was fixed at session start, so the new tool was unusable in
  that session.** Owner reconnected; the dispatch still never fired.
- Owner: *"no, the whole point is for me to do not run it manually."*
- **SOLUTION: a file-based trigger.** `.github/workflows/nba-scrape.yml` patched to fire on a push to
  `nba/TRIGGER_NBA_SCRAPE.txt`; writing that file (a capability already held) fires the workflow.
  **This mechanism is still in use** — later generalised to `nba/TRIGGER_NBA_PROBE.txt`.

### T1.9 Data-quality catch and the end-to-end loop
- First successful scrape returned **`abbreviation` empty for all 30 teams** — the `TeamAbbreviation`
  column isn't in that endpoint's real response. Patched the scraper, re-triggered, verified the fix
  against the actual committed file (not the meta claim).
- Rewired the Worker to **read the GitHub-committed file first**, falling back to a direct fetch, then
  to a certified static list. Deployed.
- **Verified independently in Postgres**, not from the worker's own report:
  `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nba_ref.teams WHERE active=1` and a 5-row sample with real IDs, cities,
  conferences and divisions.

### T1.10 Artefacts created in T1
`nba/NBA_PROJECT_LOG.md` · `nba/NBA_SYSTEM_DRAFT.md` · `nba/worker_manifest_nba.json` ·
`nba/alphadog-v2-nba-static-teams.js` · `nba/scrape_nba_stats_teams.py` ·
`.github/workflows/nba-scrape.yml` · `nba/TRIGGER_NBA_SCRAPE.txt` ·
`nba/data/nba_teams_current.json` + `_meta.json` · 14 Postgres schemas ·
`nba_ref.teams` and siblings · `nba_config.worker_definitions`, `system_settings`,
`external_credentials` · memory `/areas/alphadog-nba.md` ·
patches to `generate_wrangler_configs.py`, `github_mobile_deploy_workers.py`, `alphadog-v2-admin-sql.js`

### T1.11 Findings that still govern the system
- **Cloudflare Workers cannot reach the nba.com family at all** → every NBA scrape runs on GitHub Actions.
- **`curl_cffi` browser impersonation is mandatory** — plain `requests` is TLS-fingerprinted and tarpitted.
- **A proxy alone does not help** against fingerprinting (proved: same timeout through the proxy).
- **A new MCP tool is not usable in the session that creates it** (tool list fixed at session start).
- **File-based workflow triggers** are the reliable self-service mechanism.
- **Verify in the database, never from the worker's own success claim.**
