# NBA WORKERS — every worker, scraper and script

**Purpose.** What each piece of code is, where it lives, what it does, what it needs, and what it
writes. Grouped by role.

**Update log**
| Date | What changed |
|---|---|
| 2026-09-20 | Created. Cloudflare workers and static scrapers from T1–T2; engine/board/pipeline scripts from the live session and the journal. |

---

## 0. THE FOUR-STEP WIRING PATTERN *(established T2)*

Every Cloudflare worker must be registered in four places or it will not deploy or run:
1. `nba/worker_manifest_nba.json`
2. `generate_wrangler_configs.py` — the isolated NBA branch
3. `alphadog-v2-admin-sql.js` — **bindingMap + dispatch branch + tool-schema enum** (all three)
4. `nba_config.worker_definitions` — a registry row

**`admin-sql` must deploy LAST** (the fleet deploys alphabetically from the file diff).

---

## 1. CLOUDFLARE WORKERS — Postgres writers
Pattern: read the GitHub-committed JSON → upsert into Postgres → log to `nba_control`.
They do **not** fetch from nba.com; they cannot (Cloudflare is blocked).

| Worker | job_key | Writes | Source file |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nba/alphadog-v2-nba-static-teams.js` | `nba-static-teams` | `nba_ref.teams`, `team_aliases` | `nba_teams_current.json` |
| `nba/alphadog-v2-nba-static-players.js` | `nba-static-players` | `nba_ref.players`, `player_aliases` | `nba_players_current.json` |
| `nba/alphadog-v2-nba-static-arenas.js` | `nba-static-arenas` | `nba_ref.arenas` | `nba_arenas_current.json` |
| `nba/alphadog-v2-nba-static-officials.js` | `nba-static-officials` | `nba_ref.officials` | `nba_officials_current.json` |

Each has `EXPECTED_VARS = [SYSTEM_ENV, SYSTEM_TIMEZONE, NBA_STATS_API_BASE_URL, WORKER_SAFE_MODE,
DEBUG_MODE]` and a `/debug-fetch` diagnostic route. Teams also carries a **certified static 30-team
fallback** with real stats.nba.com TEAM_IDs.

**`alphadog-v2-admin-sql.js`** (repo root, shared) — the MCP bridge. Every tool the assistant has.
**Touching it triggers a full-fleet redeploy.**

---

## 2. STATIC SCRAPERS — GitHub Actions, `nba/data/`
All use **`curl_cffi` with browser impersonation** except where noted.

| Script | Endpoint | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `scrape_nba_stats_teams.py` | `leaguestandingsv3` | `nba_teams_current.json` + `_meta` |
| `scrape_nba_stats_players.py` | `commonallplayers` | `nba_players_current.json` |
| `scrape_nba_stats_arenas.py` | **`teamdetails` → `TeamBackground`** | `nba_arenas_current.json` |
| `scrape_nba_officials.py` | **Wikipedia — plain `requests`** | `nba_officials_current.json` |
| `scrape_nba_player_bio.py` | `leaguedashplayerbiostats` | one call, whole league |
| `scrape_nba_player_tracking.py` | `leaguedashptstats` | one call |
| `scrape_nba_team_stats.py` | team stats | |
| `scrape_nba_onoff.py` | on/off splits | |
| `scrape_nba_playtypes.py` | `synergyplaytypes` | 3,364 player + 630 team |
| `scrape_nba_darko.py` | DARKO | SvelteKit hydration, 530/530 |
| `scrape_nba_shotquality.py` | shot quality | |
| `scrape_nba_schedule.py` | `scheduleleaguev2` | 2,666 games |
| `scrape_nba_periods.py` | quarter/half splits | |
| `scrape_nba_season_tables.py` | weekly as-of tables | pt_defend, hustle, clutch, coaches |
| `scrape_nba_matchups_pergame.py` | matchup shards | feeds M1 |
| `scrape_nba_injury_report.py` | NBA injury PDFs | **`INJURY_MODE`** = daily / probe / backfill |
| `scrape_referee_assignments.py` | referee assignments | ~6–7 AM PT |
| `scrape_nba_daily_delta.py` | bulk current-season | the delta |
| `scrape_nba_per_game_delta.py` | starters + officials | per new game |
| `sync_season_files_from_delta.py` | — | rebuilds season files |

---

## 3. BOARD SCRAPERS
| Script | App | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nba/scrape_prizepicks_nba_board.py` | PrizePicks | **`league_id=7`**, own env `PP_NBA_*`, output `boards/prizepicks_nba_current.json`. **Separate from MLB's `main.py`.** 4 candidate URLs; selects on **future-pickable rows**, not size. Live-tested: 192 projections, 104 demons / 52 goblins / 36 standard |
| `main.py` (root) | PrizePicks **MLB** | `league_id=2` hardcoded, output fixed. **Never use for NBA.** |
| `nba/scrape_underdog_board.py` | Underdog | `alternate_projections` = the full ladder with both sides' multipliers. `UNDERDOG_PXID`, `UNDERDOG_STATE_CONFIG`, `UNDERDOG_OUT_DIR`, `UNDERDOG_DEVICE_ID` |
| `nba/scrape_sleeper_board.py` | Sleeper | **`SLEEPER_SPORTS` defaults to `mlb,nba`** and **`SLEEPER_OUT_DIR` defaults to `.`** — both must be set |
| `nba/scrape_fliff_board.py` | Fliff | reverse-engineered from web bundles |
| Betr | Betr | bridge job, owner's Keycloak token |
| `nba/archive_live_boards.py` | all | normalises every app into `nba_market.board_snapshots`. **`ARCHIVE_LABEL` defaults to `routine`** — the decision pull must set `window` |

## 4. BASELINE ENGINE

### `nba/backtest/classification_ladder_v12.py` — THE CERTIFIED RECIPE *(now v18)*
**The single source of truth.** 60,176 bytes, 759 lines. Every production builder is a **patcher** over
it, with **anchor assertions** so a drifted patch fails loudly instead of writing silently.

**Constants** (full table and the calibration logic: see `NBA_BASELINE_CALIBRATION.md`):
`MAX_TIERS=24` · `MIN_PER_TIER=15` · `TIER_BLEND_K=5` · `LADDER_STEPS=6` ·
`BLOWOUT_MARGIN=20` / `COMPETITIVE_MARGIN=15` · `ROLE_TIERS` (6 bands) ·
`P_BLOWOUT_BINS=[0,2,4,6,8,10,12,15,99]` · `SHIFT_LAMBDA` per prop · `PLAYER_L0` **off (rejected)**.

**Env**: `BT_ASOF` · `BT_PROPS` · `BT_CUTOFF` · `BT_REPLAY` · `BT_INJURY` · `BT_LADDER_STEPS` ·
`BT_SAVE_COMPONENTS` · `BT_TRAIN`/`BT_TEST` · **`BT_CARRY` (default "1" — without it October produces
NOTHING)** · `BT_SHIFT_LAMBDA` · `BT_PLAYER_L0`.

### `nba/backtest/combos_ladder_v1.py`
Certified combos recipe — **its own `LADDER_STEPS`**. Joint simulation over calibrated marginals with
**per-player covariance**. **Requires `BT_SAVE_COMPONENTS=1` singles pickled first.**

### `nba/backtest/minutes_model_v1.py` *(T8)*
The first harness. Established the derived spread (r=0.46), `P(blowout|spread)`, the DataStreak
reproduction (5.4 vs 5.8) and team-specific starter pull (0.81 Orlando → 1.10 Dallas).

### `nba/backtest/bandfit.py` *(T8)* — the band-cell fitter.

### Production builders — the PATCHER PATTERN
> *"**The backtest harness on a PAST day is already the production computation** — every feature is
> `shift(1)`-based, so the only difference for today is the slate."*

| Script | Role |
|---|---|
| `nba/baseline/build_baseline_ladder.py` | patcher → today's slate. **Reproduces the ladder exactly** (173 players, 4,498 rows) |
| `nba/baseline/build_combos_ladder.py` | daily combos |
| `nba/baseline/build_periods_ladder.py` | daily periods |
| `nba/baseline/build_baseline_history.py` | season backfill (singles) |
| `nba/baseline/build_combos_history.py` · `build_periods_history.py` | season backfill |
| `nba/load_baseline_ladder.py` | **fetches over HTTP from the repo**; **refuses a singles-only slate** |
| `nba/load_baseline_history.py` | bulk history loader |
| `nba/nba_asof.py` | cutoffs — `PHASE1_CUTOFF_LOCAL = "16:00"` (1 PM PT) |
| `nba/nba_season.py` | **`current_season()` vs `active_stats_season()`** — the season-hardcoding fix; both honour `NBA_SEASON`. ⚠ Oct 1–2 edge case |

**A change must be applied to BOTH certified recipes** — singles and combos are separate files, each
with its own constants.

---

## 4b. CLOUDFLARE WRITER WORKERS BUILT T3–T9
All follow the same shape: **fetch the committed JSON from `raw.githubusercontent.com`** (never the
Contents API — it **silently returns empty above 1 MB**), **batched upsert through Hyperdrive**, run
summary to a `*_runs` table.

| Worker | Writes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `alphadog-v2-nba-static-players` / `-teams` / `-arenas` / `-officials` | `nba_ref.*` | the four-step wiring pattern |
| **the weekly differential worker** | `nba_stats.player_differential_log`, `nba_ref.team_differential_log`, `official_differential_log` + their 3 snapshot tables | **⚠ NEVER SCHEDULED.** Flagged unwired when built (T3); owner said *"leave like this for now"*; **P1 does not call it.** Verified empty 2026-09-20 |
| the measure-types writer | `player_game_log_usage` / `_scoring`, `team_game_log_four_factors` / `_scoring` | **`file_prefix`** input so one worker loads both backfill and delta files. Bug: the **team advanced table has no `usg_pct`/`reb_pct`** — the mapper wrote nonexistent columns |
| the starter-status writer | `player_game_starter_status` | **hardcoded `_2025_26`** until T7 — *"would silently keep loading last season's file in October."* `fetchFromGithubRaw` returns `{file, meta}`, so season is `.file.season` |
| the officials writer | `nba_stats.game_officials` | same season fix |
| the backfill worker | splits + career totals | gained a **`mode: "weekly"`** input — *"loads only those two in ~6 s instead of re-touching 79k rows"* |
| the daily-delta worker | game logs + **the DvP recompute** (210 rows = 30 × 7, current season) | **PRE-FLIGHT completeness check**: calendar Final count vs logged count, **`GAME_ID` prefix `002`**. Persists a **`known_empty_games` skip list** — without it the 3 permanently-empty games would be re-fetched *"every single day forever"* |
| **`alphadog-v2-nba-baseline-ladder` v0.1.0** | `nba_score.baseline_ladder` + `baseline_ladder_runs` | `POST /run {"asof":"YYYY-MM-DD"}`; idempotent on PK `(asof, player_id, game_id, prop, period, ot_rule, line)` |

**Registration is four edits**: bridge **binding map + direct-call list + tool enum**, plus the
**config generator** for the service binding. **NBA workers use DIRECT dispatch** (the
`BASE_HITTER_GAME_LOGS_WORKER` pattern), bypassing the queue — deliberate, per the no-orchestrator rule.
**⚠ Use NBA-specific binding names** — `DAILY_DELTA_RUNNER_WORKER` already exists as a shared/MLB
binding.

### ⚠ THE GENERATOR IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT PERSISTS
> *"**The GitHub workflow REGENERATES wrangler files before deploy, so this binding must live in the
> GENERATOR or it will be ERASED before Wrangler deploys.**"*

**Hand-edited `wrangler.json` changes do not survive a deploy.** Service bindings,
`compatibility_flags`, cron triggers and vars all belong in `generate_wrangler_configs.py`.
**This is why it is four edits, not three.**

### ⚠ THE NEVER-FIRE CRON IDIOM
```python
cfg["triggers"] = {"crons": ["0 0 30 2 *"]}   # February 30th — cannot occur
```
Used on **8 MLB workers** to **disable a schedule while keeping the worker deployed and callable**.
**Before concluding any worker is scheduled, check its cron for this pattern.**
| `nba/backtest/combos_ladder_v1.py` | the certified combos recipe — **its own `LADDER_STEPS`** |
| *(duplicate block removed 2026-09-20 — see §4 and §4b above)* |

**The patcher pattern:** production builders are string-transformers over the certified recipes, so the
certified file is never forked. A change must be applied to **both** recipes — singles and combos are
separate certified files each with its own constant.

## 5. SCORING ENGINE
| Script | Writes |
|---|---|
| `nba/build_final_hp.py` | `nba_score.final_hp` — the full chain. `FE_SEASONS`, `FE_PROPS`, `FE_WRITE`, **`FE_DATE`** (scopes to one slate: seconds vs ~90 min) |

---

## 6. VERIFIERS
| Script | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `nba/certify_pipeline.py` | per-pipeline artefacts present and fresh — **`PIPE=p1\|p2\|p3`**, exits non-zero |
| `nba/check_delta_gaps.py` | **no silent delta hole** — dates, games, both teams, roster rate, freshness |
| `nba/check_baseline_board_coverage.py` | board legs covered by the ladder |
| `nba/check_season_coverage.py` | season-wide coverage (89.6% of the real PP board) |
| `nba/find_delta_test_date.py` | finds dates that exercise the reallocation branch |
| `nba/measure_report_cutoff.py` | empirical cutoff measurement |
| `nba/run_storage_diet.py` | VACUUM + index audit, **row-count guards** |
| `nba/nba_names.py` | shared name resolution — `nba_ref.player_name_map`, 5,212 players |

---

## 7. WORKFLOWS
| Workflow | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `nba-p1-weekly-static.yml` | **cron Mondays 12:00 PT** |
| `nba-p2-overnight-heavy.yml` | dispatch (cron at season start: 01:00 PT) |
| `nba-p3-afternoon-light.yml` | dispatch (cron at season start: 1:15 PM PT) |
| `nba-boards-market.yml` | dispatch — own concurrency group, never queues behind MLB |
| `nba-engine-test.yml` | dispatch — **read-only, own queue**, so a 4-min test never waits on a 45-min write |
| `nba-scrape.yml` | push to `nba/TRIGGER_NBA_SCRAPE.txt` |
| `nba-probe.yml` | push to `nba/TRIGGER_NBA_PROBE.txt` (`script: <name>.py`) |
| `nba-baseline-history.yml` / `nba-combos-history.yml` / `nba-periods-history.yml` | dispatch, per prop pair per season |
| `nba-daily-delta.yml` · `nba-overnight-queue.yml` · `nba-season-tables.yml` | dispatch |

**Every workflow:** `persist-credentials: true`, **retry-with-rebase on push**, and **no
`|| echo failed`**.
