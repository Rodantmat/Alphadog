# ALPHADOG — LIVING LOG (Incremental/Delta Postgres Migration Phase)

Continuously updated. Last real state always at the bottom of the current session block.

---

## Session start — 2026-07-20/21

**Context confirmed with Rodolfo:**
- Read ALPHADOG_HANDOFF.md and ALPHADOG_DOS_AND_DONTS.md in full, twice. Verified via detailed Q&A (biggest mistake / prepare:false, 4+ specific bugs, 8 static stages incl. 2 mislabeled files, exact row counts, freshness gate window+scope, chunk sizes).
- Priority order confirmed: certifier first, then delta workers in this order:
  1. hitter game logs
  2. pitcher game logs
  3. team game logs
  4. starter history
  5. bullpen history
  6. hitter metrics
  7. pitcher metrics
  8. hitter splits
  9. pitcher splits
  10. daily-context layers (weather, umpire, availability, schedule spot)
  11. calculated layers (classification/baseline/expansion) — last, D1 read-only comparison exception applies here only

**Per-worker process (mandatory, no skipping):**
1. Verify current D1 data is correct/complete (real check, not assumed)
2. Rewire fully to Postgres
3. Run 3 successive times, confirm real/stable/correct results
4. Only then move to next worker

**Hard adjustments applied to every port:**
- No duplicate staging tables (main table holds everything; static-players is the only legitimate exception)
- Surgical port only — no redesign of working D1 logic
- `prepare: false` on every Postgres connection, no exceptions
- Bulk inserts via `sql(array, columns)`, ~200 rows/chunk — not individual-row
- Differential/dedupe checks scoped by `source_key`, not just natural key
- Freshness gate (bounded watermark) wherever source has no cheap "what changed" signal
- Chunking (`partial_continue` + `continuation_input_json`) for any worker with many external calls/writes per invocation

**Other confirmed scope notes:**
- SCORING_DB investigation: mine to do, via grep, before asking — not yet started.
- Correlation-aware enrichment wiring: explicitly OUT of scope for this phase.
- D1 fully off limits except calculated-layer read-only comparison (Section 5 of HANDOFF.md) — not relevant yet since we're starting with certifier + raw delta layers.

**Status: STARTING — "the certifier" first.**
- Assuming this means `alphadog-v2-delta-certifier.js` (the delta-layer certifier, analogous to static-certifier for the static layer) — about to open the file to confirm this is correct before doing anything else.
